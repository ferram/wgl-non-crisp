G\"odel modal logics, $\GKL$s, provide a natural framework for reasoning
about graded notions of incompleteness, uncertainty, and vagueness by
means of necessity and possibility operators evaluated over truth
degrees. When interpreted over the real unit interval, G\"odel logic
captures a well-behaved notion of implication based on residuation,
which makes it particularly suitable for applications in knowledge
representation, as well as in multi-agent and distributed systems.


In general, the semantics of $\GKL$ is based on G\"odel Kripke models
(\emph{\GM-models}), a natural generalization of classical Kripke
semantics in which both the valuation of propositions at each world
and the accessibility relation take values in the standard G\"odel
algebra $[0,1]$, i.e.\ the algebraic semantics of the intermediate
G\"odel--Dummett logic. The minimal logics over {\GM-models} were
thoroughly investigated by Caicedo and Rodr\'iguez
in~\cite{CaiRod2010,CaiRod2015}.  In this setting, the interpretation
of the modal operators is defined by means of infima and suprema
computed over (possibly infinite) sets of accessible worlds. However,
these bounds need not be attained: the infimum may be strictly smaller
than every truth value in the set, and dually for the
supremum. Consequently, the truth value of a modal formula may depend
on limit constructions rather than on concrete worlds of the model.

This phenomenon has significant logical consequences. For instance,
\cite{CaiRod2010} shows that the formula $\Box \neg \neg \varphi \to
\neg \neg \Box \varphi$ is valid in all finite G\"odel Kripke models,
but fails in a suitable infinite model (see
Fig.\ref{fig:nonWitn}). Hence, the underlying logic does not enjoy the
finite model property, and semantic arguments may require genuinely
infinitary behavior.

Witnessed models provide a principled way to overcome these
difficulties. By requiring that the relevant infima and suprema be
realized by actual accessible worlds, witnessed semantics ensures that
existential and universal behavior is supported by explicit
witnesses. In this way, the evaluation of modal operators more closely
mirrors the behavior of guarded quantification in first-order logic
and restores a constructive reading of the semantics. Each modal
statement is thus justified by concrete worlds rather than by purely
asymptotic approximations.

The notion of witnessed models has appeared in several related
contexts. For example, in~\cite{HC2006} an axiomatization is given for
witnessed semantics in fuzzy predicate logics. Since quantified
statements can often be translated into modal ones, this connection is
conceptually well grounded. Along these lines, H\'ajek considers
in~\cite{HajekS5} the axioms $\Diamond(\varphi \to \Box \varphi)$ and
$\Diamond(\Diamond \varphi \to \varphi)$, and proves that the resulting
logic $S5(G)^w$ is strongly complete with respect to witnessed
universal Kripke models.

Witnessed semantics has also proved fruitful in applied settings. In
the context of Fuzzy Description Logics, \cite{BDP2014} studies a
system based on witnessed G\"odel semantics and shows that it enjoys
the finite model property and a decidable satisfiability problem with
exponential-time complexity. More recently, \cite{RV26} provides an
axiomatization for modal G\"odel logic interpreted over witnessed
Kripke models.

In general, witnessed models tend to ensure compactness-like properties and
often yield the finite model property and decidability
results. These features are crucial for automated reasoning,
%%verification, and implementation, 
since they allow infinitary semantic arguments to be replaced by
finite combinatorial ones. For these reasons, studying G\"odel modal
logics over witnessed models not only clarifies their semantic
foundations but also strengthens their connections with well-behaved
fragments of first-order logic that play a central role in computer
science, thereby enhancing both their theoretical robustness and their
applicability.

The existence of witnesses enables canonical model constructions that
are finite or finitely generated, supports filtration techniques, and
allows completeness proofs to proceed by standard algebraic or
canonical methods. Therefore, establishing a sound and complete
calculus for G\"odel modal logics over witnessed models is not only
feasible but also conceptually justified, providing a proof-theoretic
counterpart to their improved semantic behavior and paving the way for
effective automated reasoning procedures.


In line with the above considerations, in~\cite{FerFioRod:2025} we
introduced the logic $\GWCL$ characterized by witnessed crisp G\"odel
Kripke models, where ``crisp'' means that the accessibility relation
takes values in the set $\{0,1\}$.  For this logic, we developed a
constraint-based refutation calculus inspired by the tableau system
of~\cite{BilkovaFK:22}, together with a terminating proof-search
procedure that yields finite countermodels whenever proof search
fails. As a consequence, we established that $\GWCL$ enjoys the finite
model property.  In the present work, we extend these results to the
logic $\GWL$, characterized by witnessed G\"odel–Kripke models without
the crispness restriction. Our development follows the
strategy adopted in~\cite{FerFioRod:2025}.  We introduce a
constraint-based refutation calculus for $\GWL$, we call $\Calcw$, and
prove its soundness and completeness with respect to witnessed
models. Moreover, we design a terminating proof-search procedure for
$\Calcw$ based on a standard backward search strategy.  Notably, when
proof search fails, the computation can be traced to construct a
finite countermodel for the given formula, and this proves the finite
model property for $\GWL$.  Finally, we provide an implementation of
the procedure, called \texttt{gwref} (available
at~\cite{gwrefProver}).
